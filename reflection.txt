Branches make teamwork way easier because they let everyone work on their own part of the project without interfering with other people. The main branch stays safe, and you only merge in changes once you know they’re correct. This prevents stuff like breaking the whole project with one bad push, losing someone’s work, or constantly dealing with conflicts when multiple people edit the same files.
